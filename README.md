# Repository Pattern + Unit of Work — Simple Implementation

This project is a simple implementation of **Repository Pattern** combined with **Unit of Work** in ASP.NET Core Web API.  
The goal is to demonstrate how to structure data access logic in a clean, modular, and maintainable way.

---

## 📌 What is the Repository Pattern?
The Repository Pattern is a design pattern used to separate the data access logic from the business logic.  
It provides a clean abstraction over the data layer and makes your application easier to maintain, test, and extend.

## 🚀 Features

- Generic Repository for common CRUD operations  
- Specific Repositories (if needed)  
- Unit of Work to manage multiple repositories under one transaction  
- Clean separation between **Data Layer** and **Application Layer**  
- EF Core Integration  
- Simple API endpoints for testing
